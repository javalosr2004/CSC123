      <h2>What Not To Do</h2>
      <p>
        The time is here. Only couple of months before your off to college and you won't have to deal with your
        annoying brother, while your waiting though, there are a couple things you should <b>avoid</b> doing while
        preparing
        for this new voyage.
      </p>
      <div class='header_list'>
        <h3>1. Ghosting your friends</h3>
        <p>
          Ghosting your friends is not cool. These people supported you for so long and even if your life's direction
          isn't going in the same way as theirs, it doesn't mean that you should break off your friendship. Theres a
          reason why you became friends in the first place, instead of abandoning said friendship, you should instead
          try
          to cherish
          and make even more memories with them.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class='header_list'>
        <h3>2. Watching tiktoks all day</h3>
        <p>
          Go do something. Even if it's going for a walk, you'll regret not doing more while you have all this free
          time,
          because trust me you'll find youself with a lot less of it while your at college. Find your passion or let
          your
          creative side run free, take on new skills or goof around, just do something. Scrolling on tiktok won't
          benefit
          you as much as drawing or hiking will.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class='header_list'>
        <h3>3. Not spending time with family</h3>
        <p>
          Just as important if not even more important than spending time with friends is spending time with your
          family.
          If you live far away from the college you will be attending, then it might be for a couple months that you
          won't
          be able to see them again. Make sure to show them that you care and that you will miss them, this can be by
          just
          telling them or by doing more stuff together like going out to eat, going to the park or playing family games.

      <h2>1 Week Before Move-In</h2>
      <p>
        Don't panic. I know you only have a week left but that doesn't mean that you should just start grabbing
        everything you can think of. Take the time to plan out what you really need and what you can leave, because
        unless you have a quad bedroom at <b><i>yakʔitʸutʸu</i></b> you won't really be able to fit alot, and the stuff
        you
        do
        manage to pack will mostly be clothes. You will forget essentials. Which is why I'm going to give you a table of
        everything you will <b>MOST DEFINITELY</b> be needing in college.

      <h2>The Day</h2>
      <p>
        So the days finally here. Your stuffs been packed up and your driving to the school. These might be the last
        couple moments you spend with your family for a long time. Cherish them. Make sure to have read
        your school's moving day instructions, some will ask you to take a different route than what Google Maps says.
        When you reach your drop off location, ask the people helping out for directions to your dorm and begin the
        laborous
        proccess of moving things in. This will be where you sleep, study, have fun, relax, so make sure to spend the
        proper amount of time organizing it and making your dorm look nice. If you can, try to go to a restauraunt with
        your
        family afterwards, as this is where your life begins to seperate from theirs.

      <h2>Now What</h2>
      <p>So your all alone now. Get out of your dorm and make friends. This initial week is the easiest and best
        time to do so. You will meet people with different backgrounds and different personalities. Just go out there
        and talk, this week is meant for it. Find some place downtown to eat at, go explore the mountains, go kayaking,
        join clubs, play sports,
        do what excites. After 12 years, you are now here, you are in college. This is the start of your life.</p>
